I'M HAVING TROUBLE CHANGING THE DELIMITERS PROPERLY BUT FUCK IT, WE NEED TO MOVE ON.

We can just change JS delimiters too:

AngularJS modules define AngularJS applications.

AngularJS controllers control AngularJS applications.

The ng-app directive defines the application, the ng-controller directive defines the controller.


For larger files, it's a good idea to store the controller in a seperate file,(namesController.js)

All applications have a $rootScope which is the scope created on the HTML element that contains the ng-app directive.
The rootScope is available in the entire application.
If a variable has the same name in both the current scope and in the rootScope, the application uses the one in the current scope.

In AngularJS, a service is a function, or object, that is available for, and limited to, your AngularJS application.
The $location service has methods which return information about the location of the current web page:



Once you have created a service, and connected it to your application, you can use the service in any controller, directive, filter, or even inside other services.
