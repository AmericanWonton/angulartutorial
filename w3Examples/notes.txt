I'M HAVING TROUBLE CHANGING THE DELIMITERS PROPERLY BUT FUCK IT, WE NEED TO MOVE ON.

AngularJS modules define AngularJS applications.

AngularJS controllers control AngularJS applications.

The ng-app directive defines the application, the ng-controller directive defines the controller.


For larger files, it's a good idea to store the controller in a seperate file,(namesController.js)

All applications have a $rootScope which is the scope created on the HTML element that contains the ng-app directive.
The rootScope is available in the entire application.
If a variable has the same name in both the current scope and in the rootScope, the application uses the one in the current scope.

In AngularJS, a service is a function, or object, that is available for, and limited to, your AngularJS application.
The $location service has methods which return information about the location of the current web page:



Once you have created a service, and connected it to your application, you can use the service in any controller, directive, filter, or even inside other services.

The AngularJS Global API is a set of global JavaScript functions for performing common tasks like:

There's some apis functions that CAN be useful...best to stick with what you need tho


You can use 'Include' to include Angular JS code. This can be HTML files you include containing 
MORE AngularJS code.
If you want to include files from OTHER domains, you'll have to whitelist it in the config of your application


For the animation section, make sure you add the 'ngAnimate' in your JavaScriptYou also need the tag
at the top of the page

If you want to navigate to different pages in your application, but you also want the application to be a SPA (Single Page Application),
 with no page reloading, you can use the ngRoute module.
