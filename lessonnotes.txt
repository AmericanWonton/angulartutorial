What is angular? A.) A Framework for building client applications in HTML CSS and javascript/typescript

Angular gives our application a clean structure with utility code you can use in other apps 

This makes the app much easier to typescript

You don't need it...but it helps!

* Front-end - User interacts with it; HTML CSS, Typescript, Angular

*Back-end - Responsible for data

Front-end works with backend to display data. YOU DON'T SAVE DATA WITH ANGULAR

You need node.js; it's a runtime enviornment for executing javascript code outside the browser
